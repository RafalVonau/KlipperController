# Klipper Controler
Simple software to control a 3D printer controlled with Klipper software.

I am using an "Ender3 PRO" 3D printer controlled from a Raspberry PI2 via Klipper software (see https://www.klipper3d.org/).
PI2 is not powerful enough to handle octoprint well in the printer room and I don't have access to a computer so editing the klipper.cfg configuration file is problematic.

I decided to write my own software to control the printer. This software is divided into 2 parts:
* A server written in C that runs on a raspberry PI2 (RPC).
* Software written in flutter for an Android/iOS cell phone to control the 3D printer.

Features:
- Upload files from internal/external cell phone storage to Raspberry PI (virtual SD card directory)
- Edit the Klipper configuration file on cell phone
- View klipper log file
- Start 3D print from the Klipper virtual SD card
- Control temperature and motor movement with a cell phone
- Monitor print progress and head/bed temperatures

# Building server on PI
* install git and gcc compiler on pi (sudo apt install git gcc)
* log in to PI (ssh)
* git clone https://github.com/BubuHub/KlipperController.git
* cd KlipperController/print-server-c
* make
* sudo make install
* edit configuration file in /etc/default/print-server  
type:  
  sudo systemctl stop print-server  
  sudo mcedit /etc/default/print-server  
change paths:  
UPLOAD_DIR= - type path to virtual SD card (as configured in klipper.cfg)  
KLIPPER_CFG= - type path to klipper config file  
KLIPPER_LOG= - type path to klipper log file  
  save (F2) and exit (F10)  
  sudo systemctl start print-server  

NOTE: I assume that Klipper is run by a user named "pi". If not, modify the user/group name in systemd service file /etc/systemd/system/print-server.service

# Building application for Android/iOS
* install flutter - follow instrictions from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
* git clone https://github.com/BubuHub/KlipperController.git
* cd myocto
* flutter pub get
* flutter build apk --split-per-abi
